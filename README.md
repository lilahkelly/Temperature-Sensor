# Temperature-Sensor
This project uses a PIC 24 microcontroller to simulate a temperature alarm using C. It demonstrates my knowledge of using code with microcontrollers, C, reading ADC values and converting them into Farhenheit, HLSM as seen in the report, and testing for microcontrollers with code.
